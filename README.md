# DSSG - Data Engineering Workshop ü™†‚ù§Ô∏è

Welcome to the Data Engineering Workshop organized by the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) community. This workshop is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to the data engineering workflow and tools. The intended audience is data scientists and analysts who are interested in learning how to build simple data pipelines and data warehouses.

## Workshop Setup

For this workshop we prepared a documentation page that will guide us through the different modules and exercises. You can find it [here](https://rogall-e.github.io/DSSG-Data-Engineering-Workshop/).

## We will learn to:
- Set up a basic Analytical Database using DuckDB
- Read some data from various sources into our database with Airbyte
- Transform the data into a unified view with dbt
- Attach a visualization tool to the database using Metabase

## We are **not** touching:
- Buildig a production-ready data pipeline.
- Setting up cloud infrastructure
- Orchestrating complext data pipelines with lots of dependencies
- Interacting with all the bells and whistles of the tools we will use.
