# What are the side effects of storing data?

## Security
When you store a lot of sensitive data in one easy to access place you also need to make sure only allowed people can access is. 
The downsides of doing things centrally are that it is by far easier to make mistakes and expose data to the wrong people.

## GDPR
In the EU we have the GDPR. This is a law that regulates how data can be stored and processed. Have in mind that if you store data in a central place you need to make sure that you are compliant with the GDPR. Some examples of things you need to consider are:

- If you store customer data you need to make sure that you can delete it if a customer requests it.
- You need to make sure that you only store data that you actually need. You are not allowed to store data that you do not have valid business reason for.


!!! note

    Luckily your are not requested to have automated procedures for all of this in place from the beginnnig. So as long as you have a process in place that allows you to do this manually you are fine. But you should consider this when you start building your data warehouse and move into automation as soon as possible.
