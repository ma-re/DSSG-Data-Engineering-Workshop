# Why SQL is great.
We know that you probably love your pandas. But today there will be no fluffy stuff for you. We will use SQL.

- SQL is the most widely used language for data analysis and it is also the most widely used language for data warehousing. 
- It is a very powerful language and it is also very easy to learn. 
- This also means that lots of other people outside of the data bubble have at least some knowledge of SQL. Software engineers, product managers, business analysts, and many others.
- It is mostly standardized. This means that you can use the same SQL code on different databases.


!!! tip "We want things to be boring!"
    Boring things have tons of benefits. They tend to stay boring in the same way which means they will work the same way in 5 or 10 or 20 years. At least chances are much higher.
