# How organisations store data

I would claim that all organisations store data in some kind of database. Most start with something like Excel or Google Sheets and most also never stop to use Spreadsheet. What changes over the years might be the amount of data and the growing urge to have more control over it. **Following this urge of handling the chaos might be called Data Engineering.**
