# Data Destinations

Most of the time the Destination for your data will be a database. But there are also other options like files or APIs. It could be that some of your stakeholders want the data delivered to another destination via a SFTP Server or an S3 Bucket. Options are endless.

!!! note
    Most propably you will spend 95% of your time with your data warehouse or lake as destination. So we will focus on that for now. Luckily you are prepared to also move data out from there easily using e.g. Airbyte.
