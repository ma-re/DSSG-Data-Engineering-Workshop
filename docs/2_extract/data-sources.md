# Data Sources
Almost everything that you gives you structured information in some way can act as a data source for your data ingestion.
We already discussed spreadsheets but there is much more. You can get data from databases, APIs, files, and many more:

- Static Files (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML, ...)
- APIs (e.g. REST, GraphQL, ...) -> That also serve something like JSON
- other Databases (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, ...)
