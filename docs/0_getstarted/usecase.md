# The Yearly Pokemon Fundraiser

Learning things is fun! But learning things is also hard. And sometimes it is even harder to learn things that you already know. And most potentially you already know a lot of the things we will talk about today to some extend. What is new today might be that we try to glue everything together to solve one common use case of data engineering. And we will do so while solving the problem of the Pokemon Catastrophe.


So lets start with what most work related things start with: **A Problem**. Honestly we do not care to much about Pokemon. But we do care about data engineering. And we want to learn about data. And luckily there is a lot of data about Pokemon. So lets use that data to learn about data engineering. And to make it a bit more interesting, we will not just learn about data engineering but we will also help the Pokemon to collect donations for a good cause.

**So lets hear a bit more about it** 

 Each year all Pokemon come together and collect money for a good cause. This year, the Pokemon agreed on collecting money to renovate all schools in the Kanto area.

 Last years fundraiser was a huge success and this year, a **small group of Pokemon Scientists** wants to find out a more about the donating behavior of the Pokemon. 

 Their main research questions are: 

 - *What type of Pokemon type is donating the most on average?*
 - *On what day are Pokemon donating the most?*

 The scientists collected some data, but struggle to get insights out of it. 
 
 **So let's jump right in and help them out!**
