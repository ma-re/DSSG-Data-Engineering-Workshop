## What to expect
We are going to build a simple data pipeline that extracts data from a public API, stores it in a database, and makes it available for analysis. We will use a variety of tools to achieve this goal and we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The workshop will be a mix of presentations and hands-on exercises.

- Writing SQL queries
- Hearing some technical jargon like API, ETL, ELT, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, etc. We will explain what all of these terms mean.

## What not to expect
- Buildig a production-ready data pipeline.
- Interacting with all the bells and whistles of the tools we will use. We will focus on the core functionality.
- Lots to time to discuss the pros and cons of each tool. We will provide some first impressions and resources for further learning.
