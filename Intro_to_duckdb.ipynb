    "# Introduction to DuckDB\n",
    "\n",
    "[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an open-source analytical SQL database management system designed for high performance and efficiency. It's built to excel in handling complex analytical queries on large volumes of data while maintaining a lightweight footprint. DuckDB is known for its exceptional speed in executing queries and its ability to operate seamlessly within various environments, from laptops to large-scale server setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of its standout features is its support for standard SQL queries, making it accessible to users familiar with SQL syntax. Additionally, DuckDB is optimized for read-heavy workloads, making it an ideal choice for data exploration, analytics, and research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB also provides integration with popular data science tools like Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas, facilitating a smooth workflow for analysts and data scientists. Its compatibility with Jupyter Notebooks allows for an interactive and collaborative environment where users can harness DuckDB's power alongside their code and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, DuckDB's integration with Pandas simplifies data manipulation and analysis. It enables the execution of SQL queries directly on Pandas DataFrames, providing a familiar interface for those comfortable with Pandas while leveraging DuckDB's speed and efficiency for data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable aspect is that it can handle various data formats such as CSV, Parquet, and others. And let's you interact with these formats through SQL queries streamlines the process of querying and analyzing diverse data sources without the need for extensive data preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So DuckDB offers a user-friendly environment for data exploration, analysis, and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started let's import duckdb and pandas. To be able to convert jupyter notebook cells to sql cells we need to also load the jupysql extension."
